    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the learning process, students can sometimes feel overwhelmed when receiving too much information at the same time. To solve this, teachers need to manage how information is delivered. This is explained in Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory. In this explanation, I will describe how I use WhatsApp Group in my learning activities to manage students' cognitive load.</p>

    <h2>Intrinsic Load</h2>
    <p>Intrinsic load is related to the complexity of the material itself. In my activity, the teacher divides complex material into simpler parts before sharing it in WhatsApp Group. This makes it easier for students to understand one concept before moving on to the next. It helps reduce the difficulty students feel when receiving new material.</p>

    <h2>Extraneous Load</h2>
    <p>Extraneous load comes from unnecessary information or confusing instructions. In my learning activity, the teacher avoids sending too much unrelated information in the group. The teacher also gives clear and simple instructions. This helps students focus on the important points and reduces distractions in the learning process.</p>

    <h2>Application Example</h2>
    <p>For example, when discussing an English short story, the teacher first sends a summary of the story, followed by important vocabulary. After that, students are asked to answer a few questions in the group. This step-by-step process manages the cognitive load so students don’t feel overwhelmed.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>By using this method, students can process information better and learn more effectively. Managing cognitive load in WhatsApp Group makes the discussion clear, organized, and easy to follow. It also supports students in focusing on key points without getting lost in too much information.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From this activity, we can see that WhatsApp Group can be a good digital platform to manage cognitive load by adjusting the way information is delivered. By reducing intrinsic and extraneous load, students can focus better and improve their learning experience.</p>
