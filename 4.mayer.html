    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the learning process, students often receive information in many different ways, such as text, images, and audio. To help students learn better, teachers need to manage how they present information. This is explained in Mayer’s Multimedia Learning Theory. In this explanation, I will describe how I use WhatsApp Group based on Mayer's theory.</p>

    <h2>Dual-Channel Processing</h2>
    <p>According to Mayer, people learn better when information is presented through both visual and verbal channels. In my activity, the teacher shares material in text form, images, and sometimes audio or video in the WhatsApp Group. This helps students process information using both their visual and auditory memory, making learning more effective.</p>

    <h2>Application Example</h2>
    <p>For example, when discussing an English short story, the teacher sends a short video summary of the story along with the text. Then, students are asked to answer questions based on both the video and text. This supports Mayer's idea that combining text and visuals makes learning clearer and easier to remember.</p>

    <h2>Managing Cognitive Load</h2>
    <p>Using different media types helps manage cognitive load because it divides information into smaller, easier parts. Instead of sending long texts, the teacher uses images and videos to explain difficult points. This helps students avoid confusion and stay focused on the important information.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>By applying multimedia learning in WhatsApp Group, students can learn more actively and enjoy the process. It also makes the learning process more interesting because students are not only reading texts but also watching videos and seeing pictures related to the topic.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From this activity, we can see that WhatsApp Group can support Mayer’s Multimedia Learning Theory by combining text, images, and audio. It makes learning more meaningful and easier for students to understand and remember.</p>
