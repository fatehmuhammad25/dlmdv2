  <h1>Vygotsky's Social Constructivism</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this digital era, many teachers and students use different digital platforms to support the teaching and learning process. One of the popular platforms in Indonesia is WhatsApp Group. It is a simple and easy-to-use application for communication, especially in education. In this explanation, I will describe how I use WhatsApp Group in my learning activities and how it follows the principles of social constructivism theory by Vygotsky.</p>

    <h2>Use of WhatsApp Group</h2>
    <p>I use WhatsApp Group as a digital media for sharing materials, discussing topics, asking questions, and giving feedback. In my learning activity, the teacher usually shares the topic or material in the group. After that, students can ask questions, give their opinions, and respond to other students' answers in the group chat. Sometimes, the teacher gives instructions and guidance when students have difficulties understanding the material.</p>

    <h2>Activity Example</h2>
    <p>We also use WhatsApp Group to make simple group discussions. The teacher will give a question or a topic, and then students discuss it together in the chat room. Students are free to share ideas, pictures, videos, or voice notes. This makes the learning process more active and interactive because every student has a chance to speak and give their opinion.</p>

    <h2>Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</h2>
    <p>This activity in WhatsApp Group supports social interaction because students can communicate and share ideas with each other. According to Vygotsky, students learn better through interaction. Also, when students help their friends to understand the material, it supports the idea of Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), where students can learn better with help from others.</p>

    <h2>Scaffolding</h2>
    <p>The teacher also gives hints or corrections when students have difficulties. This is called scaffolding, which means giving help until students can do it by themselves. When students work together to discuss and share ideas, it shows collaborative learning, where students learn as a group, not alone.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By using WhatsApp Group, students actively interact and share ideas, which makes the learning process collaborative and dynamic. This supports Vygotsky's theory that social interaction plays a key role in effective learning.</p>
