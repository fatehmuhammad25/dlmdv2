    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the modern learning process, teachers often use digital media to make the teaching and learning process more interesting and active. One of the digital platforms I often use is WhatsApp Group. It is simple and easy to access. In this explanation, I will describe how my teaching and learning approach using WhatsApp Group follows Piaget's Cognitive Constructivism theory.</p>

    <h2>Use of WhatsApp Group</h2>
    <p>In my activity, the teacher shares material and topics through WhatsApp Group. Students then read the material, ask questions, and answer other students' questions in the group chat. This activity allows students to think, process information, and build their own understanding based on what they read and discuss.</p>

    <h2>Application Example</h2>
    <p>For example, when the teacher gives a topic about a short story, students read it and then share their opinions. They also make conclusions based on their own understanding. This supports Piagetâ€™s idea that learning happens when students are actively involved in creating meaning from experiences, not just receiving information.</p>

    <h2>Stages of Cognitive Development</h2>
    <p>This activity is also connected with Piaget's stages of cognitive development. Most of the students in my class are in the formal operational stage, where they can think logically, solve problems, and discuss abstract ideas. By using WhatsApp Group, students can practice those skills by discussing, asking, and answering questions about the topic.</p>

    <h2>Constructing Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Students learn to connect new information with what they already know. When students give their opinions and discuss with friends, they develop their knowledge through interaction. Piaget said that knowledge is built by the students themselves, and this process happens well in group discussions using WhatsApp Group.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From this activity, we can see that WhatsApp Group supports the principles of Piaget's Cognitive Constructivism. Students are actively involved, think critically, and construct their own knowledge through experience and interaction. This makes the learning process more meaningful and effective for students.</p>
